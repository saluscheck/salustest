This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(httr)
library(tidyverse)
library(xml2)
r <- GET("https://testapi.aml-check.com/v3/namecheck.asmx/CheckFullName?DateFrom=1981-01-01&Code=aaa&FullName=mugabe&Probabilite=100")

xmlDoc <- content(r, as = "parsed") %>% as_list
xmlDoc$ArrayOfHit

```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
